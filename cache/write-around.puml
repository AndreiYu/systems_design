    Data is written directly to the database and only the data that is read makes it way into the cache.
    Write-around can be combine with read-through and provides good performance in situations where data is written once and read less frequently or never. For example, real-time logs or chatroom messages.
    Likewise, this pattern can be combined with cache-aside as well.
