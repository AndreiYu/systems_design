    Read-through caches work best for read-heavy workloads when the same data is requested many times. For example, a news story. The disadvantage is that when the data is requested the first time,
    it always results in cache miss and incurs the extra penalty of loading data to the cache.
    Developers deal with this by ‘warming’ or ‘pre-heating’ the cache by issuing queries manually.
    In cache-aside, the application is responsible for fetching data from the database and populating the cache. In read-through, this logic is usually supported by the library or stand-alone cache provider.
    Unlike cache-aside, the data model in read-through cache cannot be different than that of the database.
