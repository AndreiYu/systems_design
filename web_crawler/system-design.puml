1) Add seed URLs to the URL Frontier
2) HTML Downloader fetches a list of URLs from URL Frontier.
3) HTML Downloader gets IP addresses of URLs from DNS resolver and starts downloading.
4) Content Parser parses HTML pages and checks if pages are malformed.
5:) After content is parsed and validated, it is passed to the “Content Seen?” component.
6) “Content Seen” component checks if a HTML page is already in the storage.
• If it is in the storage, this means the same content in a different URL has already been processed. In this case, the HTML page is discarded. (<b>Hash check or bloom filter used here</b>)
• If it is not in the storage, the system has not processed the same content before. The content is passed to Link Extractor.
7) Link extractor extracts links from HTML pages.
8) Extracted links are passed to the URL filter.
9) After links are filtered, they are passed to the “URL Seen?” component.
10) “URL Seen” component checks if a URL is already in the storage, if yes, it is processed before, and nothing needs to be done.
11) If a URL has not been processed before, it is added to the URL Frontier.
